[ ] file ownership "type" model?
    - unique owner (server, client 1, client 2, etc)
    - shared owner (syncing files)

    server enforces rules based on ownership types
    certain actions cause ownership changes
        upload                -> server owner
        delete                -> client_2 owner; file deleted
        file editing          -> client_01 owner
        collaborative editing -> shared owner between clients
        syncing               -> shared owner between clients
        last session closes   -> server becomes owner by default

[ ] store filesystem state purely in the DB
    store file contents in a folder and file based on the file id Guid 
    for example, file guid: a218e589-04a2-475a-a13a-d40743fc2893

    would be in /store/files/user_id/a2/18e589-04a2-475a-a13a-d40743fc2893
    this both makes file lookup quick
    and files evenly spread across folders, and doesn't make any folders particularly huge
